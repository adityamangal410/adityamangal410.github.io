#Project Summary

With this project I will try to visualize and understand the traffic accident data for India as publicly accessible [here](https://data.gov.in/). 

## Project Goals

1. Visualize traffic information and find trends

2. Find outliers and see if any valuable info can be dugout for each state or overall.

3. Try to predict number of accidents or other useful information.

I'll put out notebooks related to the work as separate articles.
